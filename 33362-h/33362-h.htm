<h3>REMARKS.</h3>
<br />

<p>Samuel Appleton was born at New Ipswich, N.H., June 22, 1766, and
died, without issue, at his residence in Boston, on Tuesday, July 12,
1853; having just entered on the eighty-eighth year of his age.</p>

<p>In November, 1819, he married Mrs. Mary Gore, who was much younger
than himself. This union has been marked, on his side, by the most
unvarying confidence and sincere affection. He has ever found his own
delight in gratifying each wish of his wife with an almost boundless
indulgence. And she&mdash;the brilliant and happy mistress of his
hospitable mansion&mdash;has been alike admirable, when presiding over its
social circle, or its more public gayeties; and when, in its private
recesses, she has devoted herself to what she has ever felt to be her
highest duty and her chief privilege,&mdash;that of guarding the declining
years of her husband with the most kind and thoughtful care; cheering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
his pathway to the tomb by those considerate attentions, which, both
in life and in death, he so gratefully appreciated and acknowledged.</p>

<p>On the last morning of his life, he enjoyed his usual health. During
the day, however, he suffered pain and uneasiness, apparently the
result of indigestion. Mrs. Appleton, therefore, remained constantly
with him, but without feeling any serious apprehensions. He at length
seemed to be entirely relieved by the means used, and said, "I will
now try to go to sleep." In a few moments, Mrs. Appleton was alarmed
by hearing him breathe once or twice much more loudly than usual. She
ran to his bedside, and his favorite female attendant was immediately
summoned. He was still lying in the same attitude of repose. The sleep
that had fallen upon him so gently was the sleep of death!</p>

<p>This event at once called forth a universal and spontaneous expression
of regard for the deceased from the community in which he had so long
lived. It was unrestrained by any differences of political opinion or
of religious sentiment. Thus, in the "Boston Post," the organ of the
Democratic party of Boston, there appeared the following
communication:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"<span class="sc">Samuel Appleton</span> is dead! Never has there been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
summoned from among us a purer man or a more public-spirited
citizen. Possessing strong natural sense and the most plain and
unaffected manners, he was truly simple-hearted and
noble-minded. There was nothing about him of ostentation or
pretence. All his <i>acts</i>, during a long life, praise him.
Beginning with humble prospects, by industry and intelligence
he became one of our wealthiest merchants. As a country
schoolmaster, during the winter months, he was once, when a
young man, '<i>put up at auction</i>, to be boarded out in the
family that would consent to take him at the lowest rate.'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Latterly, for many years, probably not a day has passed without
the performance of some deed of kindness great or small,&mdash;some
act of public or private munificence; and each evening saw him
sink to rest, happy in the consciousness that he had made
others happy. In a notice of him, as a benefactor of one of our
chief charitable institutions, published not long since, it is
said: 'In advanced age, and unable to walk from his house, he
continues in the highest and best sense to enjoy life. He has,
indeed, no children; but a numerous band of nephews and nieces
look up to him with truly filial regard. Indeed, the community
itself ventures to apply to him <i>their</i> familiar and
affectionate appellation of "Uncle Sam." This name, in the
abstract so dear to every patriot, could not be more worthily
bestowed.'<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> That life, so honorable and so useful, rendered
sweet by the daily blessings of those whose necessities or
sufferings have been relieved by his bounty, has been fitly
closed by a calm and peaceful death."</p></div>

<p>Obituary notices of a like favorable character, and characteristic
anecdotes, &amp;c., were inserted in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>"Daily Evening Transcript," the
"Boston Courier," and the "Christian Register," and also in various
other journals.</p>

<p>Public funeral services were held at the Stone Chapel, on Friday
afternoon, at four o'clock. The Hon. Thomas H. Perkins, and a few
other surviving contemporaries of the deceased, were present among the
assemblage of relatives and friends by which the church was filled.</p>

<p>He was buried at Mount Auburn, in a lot which he had purchased many
years ago, and on which he had erected a costly monument. Designing to
embellish that field of the dead, he had authorized an artist in a
foreign country to execute this work without regard to expense. When
completed, it was not in accordance with the simple tastes of Mr.
Appleton. He even desired that he might be buried in his tomb, under a
church in Boston, rather than in the beautiful spot which he had thus
selected and adorned. The existing ordinance of the city rendered it
impossible to comply with this suggestion; and indeed it seemed to be,
on other grounds, inexpedient.</p>

<p>At a stated quarterly meeting of the Trustees of the Massachusetts
General Hospital, held on the same day, the following preamble and
votes, as proposed by the Chairman, were unanimously adopted, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"The funeral of the late Hon. Samuel Appleton takes place this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
afternoon; and the bells of the city are now tolling as a
public expression of respect for one of its worthiest sons and
its noblest benefactors, who, at the advanced age of
eighty-seven years, has died universally beloved and regretted.</p>

<p>"Formerly a Trustee of this Institution, and ever cherishing a
lively interest in its welfare, we are happy to acknowledge our
indebtedness to him, alike for his valuable personal services,
and for a large share of that bounty which he has always so
wisely and so liberally bestowed.</p>

<p>"This Board would present to the widow of the deceased, by whose
affectionate attentions and devoted care his life has been for
so many years prolonged and rendered happy, the assurances of
their profound sympathy, now that she has lost a companion and
friend by whom she was most tenderly beloved.</p>

<p>"<i>Voted</i>, That this Board do now adjourn to attend the funeral
of the deceased."</p></div>

<p>Mr. Appleton left a Will and Codicil, of which a few copies are
printed for the use of his executors and legatees.</p>

<p>These documents were opened and read in the presence of the widow and
some of the relatives, on Saturday, July 16; and the following
anecdote was then related by one of the Executors:&mdash;</p>

<p>The late Isaac Appleton Jewett was a favorite nephew of the deceased,
and, as such, had a bequest of $30,000, and was eventually to receive
besides one-tenth part of the residuary property. He died <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>in January
last, leaving as his heir-at-law a half-sister, who, by the terms of
the will, became entitled to these bequests. There was no
blood-relationship between her and the Testator. <i>A comparative
stranger would thus be a larger legatee than any one of his own
kindred.</i> The Executor called Mr. Appleton's attention to this fact.
His reply was: "I am much obliged for the suggestion: it was a proper
one for you to make. I will consider, and let you know my decision
to-morrow." The next day he said: "I have been thinking of what you
mentioned to me; and if, in the other world, there is any knowledge of
what is done in this, I should not like to have my nephew, whom I so
loved and trusted, find that my first act, on learning his death, is
the revocation or curtailment of a bequest made in his favor, and
which, if he had survived me, would have eventually benefited her who
was nearest and dearest to him. <i>The will must stand as it is.</i>" This
confirmation of a private bequest is no less honorable to the memory
of Mr. Appleton, than are those other two provisions of his will by
which he so bountifully remembers the servants of his household, and
appropriates to public uses so large a part of his princely fortune.</p>

<h2>CODICIL.</h2>
<br />

<p>I, SAMUEL APPLETON, of Boston, in the County of Suffolk, and State of
Massachusetts, merchant, having further considered my last Will and
Testament, bearing date the twenty-eighth day of February, in the year
of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-one, do think proper
to make and publish the following as a Codicil thereunto.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Revokes a clause of the Will;</div><br />

<p>I do hereby revoke and cancel that clause in said last Will and
Testament, giving unto my beloved wife "any of the plate and furniture
belonging to me at the time of my decease, at the appraised value
thereof, to the amount of eight thousand dollars;" and in lieu thereof
I do make the following dispositions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">And gives to widow his mansion-house, 37,
Beacon-street,</div><br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>

<p>I give and devise unto my beloved wife the dwelling-house, with the
stables, lands, and appurtenances thereunto belonging, now occupied by
me, being the dwelling-house numbered thirty-seven in Beacon-street,
Boston, to have and to hold the same to her, her heirs and assigns for
ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And all the plate, &amp;c. therein.</div><br />

<p>And I do also give and bequeath unto my beloved wife all the plate,
furniture, pictures, statuary, books, stores, and other household
articles, belonging to me at the time of my decease; and it is my wish
that no inventory be taken of the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Legatees may take property at appraisement, &amp;c.</div><br />

<p>And it is also my wish that each and every of the legatees, in said
last Will and Testament named, may, with the advice and consent of my
executors, take, in lieu of the money to which they are entitled by
said last Will and Testament, any of the property, left by me at the
time of my decease, at the appraised value thereof.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bonds of Executors to be only in a penalty
adequate to protect creditors.</div><br />

<p>And I do also direct that the executors of my said last Will and
Testament shall give bonds in such sum only as the Judge of Probate
may consider sufficient for the payment of the amount of my debts.</p>
